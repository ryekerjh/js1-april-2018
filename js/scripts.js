myString.toUpperCase(); // METHOD BECAUSE IT IS "CALLED ON" THE OBJECT myString (WHICH IS CONVERTED INTO A STRING OBJECT AUTOMATICALLY BY JS) AND IT IMPLICITLY CONSUMES/TAKES AS AN ARGUMENT myString. AKA WE DID NOT PASS myString INTO THE toUpperCase() FUNCTION AS PARAMETERS, BUT IT STILL PERFORMS AN OPERATION ON IT ANYWAY.
